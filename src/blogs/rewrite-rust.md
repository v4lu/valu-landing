# Intro

As our vegan social platform continues to grow, we've made the strategic decision to rewrite our backend infrastructure from Spring Boot to Rust. This article outlines our reasoning and the anticipated benefits of this significant technical transition.

## The Current Situation

Our vegan social platform has been running on Spring Boot since its inception, serving as a hub for plant-based enthusiasts to share recipes, organize meetups, and build connections. While Spring Boot has been a reliable foundation, we're starting to see opportunities for improvement as our user base expands.

## Why We're Choosing Rust

After months of research and proof-of-concept testing, we've identified several compelling reasons to make the switch to Rust:

### 1. Performance Expectations

- **Memory Efficiency**: Rust's ownership model and lack of garbage collection promise significantly lower memory usage
- **Response Times**: We expect to see substantial improvements in request handling speed
- **Resource Utilization**: Better CPU and memory utilization should allow us to serve more users with less hardware

### 2. Safety and Reliability

- Zero-cost abstractions that eliminate entire categories of runtime errors
- Thread safety guarantees at compile time
- No null pointer exceptions or data races
- Memory safety without garbage collection

### 3. Cost Optimization

- Predicted reduction in infrastructure costs due to better resource utilization
- Expected ability to handle higher concurrent user loads on existing hardware
- Potentially lower cold start times for our serverless functions

### 4. Developer Experience

- Strong type system that catches errors at compile time
- Clear ownership model that makes concurrent programming more manageable
- Growing ecosystem of high-quality libraries
- Excellent documentation and tooling

## The Migration Plan

We're approaching this migration with careful consideration:

1. **Research Phase** (Completed)

- Evaluating Rust frameworks and tools
- Building proof-of-concept services
- Consulting with teams who've made similar transitions

2. **Preparation Phase** (Current)

- Team training and workshops
- Architecture planning
- Setting up new development workflows

3. **Implementation Phase** (Upcoming)

- Starting with non-critical services
- Gradual migration of features
- Extensive testing and validation

## Expected Challenges

We're realistic about the challenges ahead:

- Learning curve for our development team
- Initial slower development velocity during the transition
- Need to rebuild some custom tools
- Potential integration challenges with existing services

## Why Now?

Several factors have aligned to make this the right time for our transition:

1. **Growth Trajectory**: We're anticipating significant user growth, and we want our infrastructure ready to scale efficiently

2. **Rust Maturity**: The Rust ecosystem has matured significantly, with production-ready frameworks and libraries available

3. **Team Readiness**: Our engineering team is excited about the challenge and ready to invest in learning Rust

4. **Business Timing**: We have the runway and support to make this strategic investment in our infrastructure

## Looking Ahead

While we're aware that rewriting a production system is a significant undertaking, we believe the long-term benefits will far outweigh the short-term challenges. We expect this migration to position us better for:

- Handling rapid user growth
- Improving user experience through better performance
- Reducing operational costs
- Building more reliable features
- Attracting talent interested in modern technology stacks

## Conclusion

Our decision to migrate to Rust represents a strategic investment in our platform's future. While Spring Boot has served us well, we're excited about the possibilities that Rust brings to our infrastructure. We look forward to sharing our actual migration journey and learnings in future articles.

Stay tuned for updates as we embark on this exciting technical evolution! ðŸ¦€
