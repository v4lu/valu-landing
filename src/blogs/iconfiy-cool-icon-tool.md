Enter Iconify, a game-changing icon framework that's revolutionizing how developers work with icons. In this post, we'll explore what makes Iconify so cool and how to use it with popular frameworks like Svelte and React.

## What is Iconify?

[Iconify](https://iconify.design/) is a unified icon framework that provides access to over 200,000 icons from more than 100 icon sets. It offers a consistent and easy-to-use API across all icon sets, making it incredibly versatile for developers.

## Why Iconify is Cool

1. **Vast Selection**: With over 200,000 icons, you're likely to find the perfect icon for any scenario.
2. **Framework Agnostic**: Iconify works with any framework or even without one.
3. **Performance Optimized**: Icons are loaded on-demand, reducing initial load times.
4. **Customizable**: Easy to customize icons with different sizes, colors, and transformations.
5. **Consistent API**: Use the same syntax across different icon sets.

## Using Iconify with Svelte

Svelte developers can easily integrate Iconify using the `@iconify/svelte` package. Here's how:

1. Install the package:

<script>
	import Icon from '@iconify/svelte';
</script>

<Icon icon="mdi:home" />
```

3. Customize the icon or just use Tailwind

```svelte
<Icon icon="mdi:home" color="red" width="32" height="32" />
<Icon icon="mdi:home" class="size-8 text-red-500" />
```

## Using Iconify with React

React developers can use the `@iconify/react` package. Here's how:

1. Install the package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @iconify/react
```

2. Import and use the Icon component:

```jsx
import { Icon } from '@iconify/react';

function MyComponent() {
	return <Icon icon="mdi:home" />;
}
```

3. Customize the icon:

```jsx
<Icon icon="mdi:home" color="blue" width="24" height="24" />
