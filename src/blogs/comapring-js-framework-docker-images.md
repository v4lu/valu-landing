# Docker Image Comparison: SvelteKit, Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Solid.js

In the world of modern web development, choosing the right framework is crucial. But equally important is how these frameworks perform in containerized environments. In this post, we'll compare Docker images for four popular web frameworks: SvelteKit, Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Solid.js. We'll look at their sizes, usage, and discuss some pros and cons of each.

## Image Sizes

Let's start by comparing the Docker image sizes for a basic "Hello World" application in each framework:

| Framework | Image Size |
|-----------|------------|
| SvelteKit | ~80MB      |
| Next.js   | ~350MB     |
| Nuxt.js   | ~300MB     |
| Solid.js  | ~100MB     |

Note: These sizes can vary based on the specific configuration and dependencies used.

## Usage Comparison

### SvelteKit

```dockerfile
FROM node-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/build build/
COPY --from=build /app/package.json .
RUN npm ci --production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "build"]
```

### Next.js

```dockerfile
FROM node-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=build /app/public ./public
COPY --from=build /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Nuxt.js

```dockerfile
FROM node-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/.output ./.output
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", ".output/server/index.mjs"]
```

### Solid.js

```dockerfile
FROM node-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Pros and Cons

### SvelteKit

Pros:

- Smallest Docker image size
- Fast build times
- Efficient runtime performance

Cons:

- Smaller ecosystem compared to React-based frameworks
- Less mature than Next.js or Nuxt.js

### Next.js

Pros:

- Large ecosystem and community support

Cons:

- React
- Larger Docker image size
- Can be overkill for simpler applications

### Nuxt.js

Pros:

- Vue.js ecosystem benefits
- Good balance of features and simplicity
- Automatic code splitting

Cons:

- Larger Docker image size than SvelteKit and Solid.js
- Learning curve for Vue.js concepts

### Solid.js

Pros:

- Lightweight and performant
- Relatively small Docker image size
- Reactive by default

Cons:

- Smaller ecosystem and community compared to others
- Less mature tooling and integrations

## Conclusion

Choosing the right framework for your Docker-based web application depends on various factors:

1. **Resource constraints**: If you're working with limited resources, SvelteKit and Solid.js offer smaller image sizes and potentially better performance.

2. **Ecosystem and community**: Next.js and Nuxt.js have larger ecosystems and more community support, which can be beneficial for complex projects.

3. **Learning curve**: Consider your team's expertise. Vue.js developers might prefer Nuxt.js, while React developers might lean towards Next.js.

4. **Scalability**: All frameworks can scale, but Next.js and Nuxt.js have more built-in features for large applications.

5. **Performance**: While all perform well, SvelteKit and Solid.js often have an edge in runtime performance.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your specific project requirements, team expertise, and performance needs. Each framework has its strengths, and Docker makes it easier to deploy and scale regardless of your choice.

Remember to always benchmark your specific application, as real-world performance can vary based on your implementation and use case.
